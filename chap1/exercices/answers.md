1. PMD or personal mobile devices like cellphones and tablets.
2. Servers
3. Personal computers (desktop and laptops)

## 1.2
All of these are open to debate. It depends on your interpretation of each... I don't like these types of questions...

a. Assembly lines in automobile manufacturing: Performance via pipelining
b. Suspension bridge cables: Dependability via redundancy
c. Aircraft and marine navigation systems that incorporation wind information: Abstraction
d. Express elevators in buildings: Common case fast
e. Library reserve desks: Hierarchy of memories
f. Increasing the gate area on a CMOS transistor to decrease its switching time: Performance via parallelism
g. Building self-driving cars whose control systems partially rely on existing sensor systems: Performance via prediction

## 1.3
A programmer will write code in a programming language like C, Javascript or Go. This code get translated by a compiler or a just in time compiler and the output is assembly. This assembly language then gets translated into machine code by an assembler. I'm sure that the last two steps are potentially done at once.
