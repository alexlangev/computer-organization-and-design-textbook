Some embedded processors in my home included the electric kettle, toaster, oven and the rest of kitchen gadgets. The is also embedded processors in my clock radio, electric razors and toothbrushes.

As for conventional computers, I am above the average. I have one laptop for each major OS and two cellphones. My partner also has one of each. 

Ultimately there is indeed more embedded computers in my home than conventional ones.

- The algorithm chosen:
    When ressources are limited or expensive, the algorithm is a good place to look for performance improvements.

- The programming language or compiler:
   Like the previous point, when improving hardware is impossible or difficult, looking for a different programming language or compiler is a good idea. (hopefully done at the start of the project) 

- The operating system:
    The OS could be a bottleneck when the program in proprietary and can't be changed. In this case, a specific OS could pottentially offer better performance.

- The processor:
    Anyone who has used older devices know that older less powerful hardware can be slow with new program. For instance, playing the latest AAA video game on a 5 year old machine. Changing the CPU can improve the performance greatly.

- The I/O system and device:
    If the application needs I/O with high amounts of data but the hardware can't support it (2.5 vs 10 gb ports)
